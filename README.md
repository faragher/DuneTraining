# Dune Training
Training from the Dune universe.

This adds training for the Sardaukar, Fedaykin, a more generic "Weirding Way," generic House militaries, and Suk doctors.

It does not include backgrounds or equipment, but does create a set of bonuses that do make them superior to other pawns of similar training and equipment, as well as preventing hardened death-world natives from going into a sad wander because they had to eat standing up.

The Suk Doctors are also universally professional and incapable of violence. As they should be. Yueh. A thousand deaths, Yueh.


Again, the balance should be considered to be largely untested, these are generally in bounds with normal starting traits, although the break threshold may be a bit much.



Thanks for all the support!
